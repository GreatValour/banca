                                <p>
                                  At Banca, we understand that there are emergencies no
                                  one can plan for, and we aren’t limited to helping only consumers
                                  with perfect credit. Sometimes a run of bad luck comes up through
                                  no fault of your own. However, as long as you meet their other
                                  requirements, some lenders or lending partners in our network may
                                  be able to offer you a loan even if you don’t have perfect credit.
                                  Keep in mind that your credit history may impact the type of loan
                                  offers you receive and the terms of the loan offers you receive
                                  and the terms of a loan offer you may receive might not be as
                                  favorable if you have bad credit. We want to help you to see if
                                  one of our available lenders or financial service providers can
                                  provide you a loan offer that can work for you.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Banca Can Help</h3>
                                <p>
                                  We know that it’s the people who are struggling that really need
                                  the personal loans, not those with the spotless credit histories
                                  who are paying all their bills on time. A perfect spending history
                                  simply isn’t possible for many American households, especially in
                                  times like these. No matter how well you’ve planned your budget
                                  and spending strategies, they can still be thrown off by one
                                  unexpected car repair or other emergency when already living
                                  paycheck to paycheck.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  An installment loan can get you to your next paycheck when there
                                  are no other solutions.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Convenient Online Form</h3>
                                <p>
                                  Our online system makes it simple to see if you qualify for a
                                  loan. Just fill out our convenient online form and you may be able
                                  to get a loan offer in minutes from our network of lenders and
                                  financial service providers. If approved, the funds can be
                                  deposited electronically into your checking account in as fast as
                                  one business day.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Some of the lenders and lending partners in our network may be
                                  willing to offer loans to borrowers with bad credit as long as
                                  they meet certain other loan criteria. Keep in mind that your
                                  credit history may impact the type of loan offers you receive and
                                  the terms of the loan offers you receive. If you have bad credit,
                                  the terms of a loan offer you may receive might not be as
                                  favorable compared to if you had good credit. Banca is
                                  free to use and you’re not obligated to accept any loan offer.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Eligibility Requirements:</h4>
                                <p>
                                  Your credit does not need to be perfect to be considered for a bad
                                  credit loan from one of the lenders or lending partners in our
                                  network. Borrowers with poor credit may still be able to qualify
                                  for a loan. Please note that meeting the requirements below does
                                  not mean you will be connected to a lender.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Requirements to complete the online form:</h4>

                                <h4>Loan Request Process:</h4>
                                <p>
                                  Our loan request process is designed to connect you with a lender
                                  from our network who can assist with your financial needs. If
                                  successfully connected, a lender will verify your information
                                  quickly and review your loan request.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Depending upon the information you provide, a lender might respond
                                  with a loan offer. You should take your time in reviewing all
                                  details of any loan you’re considering. You will not be obligated
                                  to accept the offer if it is not the right offer for you!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  When you decide to accept a loan, you must agree to the lender’s
                                  terms via e-signature. (Remember, you are under no obligation to
                                  accept any loan offered.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Once you add your electronic signature to the lender’s contract,
                                  the lender will distribute your loan funds to your checking
                                  account via direct deposit. Funds should be available as soon as
                                  the next business day, however, the exact availability timeframe
                                  will depend on your lender’s deposit process.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  If we are not able to find a lender or lending partner in our
                                  network that’s willing to offer you a loan, we may show you ads
                                  for other lenders or connect you with offers for debt relief,
                                  credit repair, or other credit-related products or services. This
                                  is not part of your loan request process. Don’t worry, we don’t
                                  show these other companies the sensitive information in your loan
                                  request. We only give them your contact information so they can
                                  contact you. You are under no obligation to accept their offers
                                  and you should carefully review their offers to you and compare
                                  them to other options available to you before accepting.
