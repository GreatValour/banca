                                        When you submit a form on this site, our proprietary loan
                                        marketplace processes this information to determine which lenders
                                        in our network have expressed interest in offering a loan to
                                        consumers like you. We then share all of your information with
                                        these lenders so they can decide whether and how much they are
                                        willing to pay us to be connected with you. If only one lender is
                                        willing to pay us to be connected to you, we connect you with that
                                        lender. If more than one lender is willing to pay us to be
                                        connected with you, our proprietary algorithm uses a number of
                                        variables to determine which lender to connect you with. However,
                                        the amount the lender is willing to pay us is likely to be the
                                        most important variable impacting which lender we connect you
                                        with.&nbsp;

                                        If none of the lenders in our network are willing to pay us to be

                                        (“Lender Networks”) to see if any of the lenders in their networks
                                        are willing to pay us to be connected with you. These Lender
                                        Networks are loan marketing companies that are commonly referred
                                        to as “lead aggregators.”

                                        These Lender Networks show your information to the lenders in
                                        their network to see if any are willing to pay them (and,
                                        indirectly, us) to be connected with you. If only one Lender
                                        Network has a lender that is willing to pay to be connected with
                                        you, we and the Lender Network connect you with that lender. If
                                        more than one Lender Network has a lender in their network that
                                        wants to pay to be connected with you, our proprietary algorithm
                                        uses a number of variables to determine which Lender Network we
                                        will use to connect you with the relevant lender in that network.
                                        However, the amount the Lender Network is willing to pay us is
                                        likely to be the most important variable impacting which Lender
                                        Network’s lender we choose to connect you with.&nbsp;

                                        Our Lender Networks do not share the identities of their lenders
                                        with us, and so we do not know which lender you are connected with
                                        if you are connected through a Lender Network. We also do not know
                                        which lenders in their network they show your information
                                        to.&nbsp;

                                        We utilize Lender Networks both because they increase the
                                        likelihood our users will be connected with a lender, and because
                                        they help us make a financial profit from our free-to-consumer
                                        service.

                                        Many of our lenders and Lender Networks (together “Lending
                                        Partners”) use service providers to manage their online consumer
                                        acquisition, facilitate their purchasing of internet traffic from
                                        websites like ours, verify your identity and information, look up
                                        your credit history, or for other reasons related to your loan
                                        request. These service providers may receive and process your data
                                        on behalf of the Lending Partners they work for. In some cases, we
                                        receive compensation from these service providers and not from the
                                        lender directly.

                                        We may connect you with a lender that offers you different loan
                                        amounts, loan terms, or rates than those you stated a preference
                                        for. If we are able to connect you with a lender, their identity
                                        will only be disclosed to you after you have submitted our form.
                                        We may redirect you to their site to see more about their loans.
                                        They may reach out to you directly by phone, SMS and/or email. You
                                        can review their offers and decide whether to take out a loan with
                                        them. We highly recommend you compare multiple lenders and offers
                                        so you can make an informed decision about your loan.&nbsp;

                                        from the advertised products or services and because it helps us

                                        These service providers may also use their own technical service
